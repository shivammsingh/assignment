Wavelabsâ€™ Lab setup consists of a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n.As a Network
Engineer, you are given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where
ui is the source node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for a signal to travel from
source to target.
We will send a signal from a given node k. Return the minimum time it takes for all the n nodes
to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the signal, return -1.
